<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Srujanika Sahu. <br />
   I am an Electrical Engineering Undergrad from Veer Surendra Sai University Of Technology,Burla. <br />

<p> My vast field of interests include Power System Engineering and it's equipments, Rocketry and it's sciences among many others.<br />
  Perhaps, "HOW THE INTERNET ACTUALLY FUNCTIONS?" is a question that fascinates and amuses me everyday. <br />
